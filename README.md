# Required packages
sudo apt install libcups2-dev

The server needs to have CUPS installed and have all the printers added to it.

# How to run the project?

1. Download from github.
1. Run `npm install` to install required modules.
1. Start your mongodb server. Needs to be running on local server.
1. Next we need to setup some configuration. Notice that there is a folder called `secret` with a `config.demo.js` file inside it. Open it and configure it and finally rename it as `config.js`. Never share the content of that file with anyone.
1. Run `npm run-script addAdmin` to add an admin to db.
1. Run `npm start` to start server.
